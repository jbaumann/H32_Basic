/*
 * H32 Basic Program
 * This is a firmware for the H32 board by Burgduino providing the following functionality:
 * OTA Updates
 * Portal for entering credentials
 * Portal allows to enter additional configuration data
 * GPIO0 leads to config portal after start (i.e. after LED is turned on)
 * A second GPIO pin is configurable as additional trigger pin
 * Store Data in NVS
 * Configurable LED pin
 * Page that allows scanning for I2C devices
 * Page showing the current measurements
 * Thingspeak communication
 * IOTPlotter Communication
 * Reading the sensor
 * Portal allows to set the RTC to NTP time
 * Failed Connection Counter stored in RTC memory
 * Dynamic, configurable increase of sleep time when WiFi is not reachable
 * MQTT
 * Extension mechanism for easy addition of user-specific code
 *
 * The following third-party libraries are used in this sketch:
 *   Adafruit_AHTX0 by Adafruit
 *   WiFiManager by tzapu
 *   Thingspeak by Mathworks
 *   PubSubClient by Nick Oâ€™Leary
 *   ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon (https://arduinojson.org/)
 *
 * These can be installed using the library manager of the Arduino IDE (or downloaded from Github)
 * An additional library for the PCF85063 by Jaakko Salo (https://github.com/jvsalo/pcf85063a) has
 * been modified to some extent and is directly included.
